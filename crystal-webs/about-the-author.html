		<h2>About the Author</h2>
		<p><b>Matthew L. Saunders</b> is the author of <i>Crystal Webs</i> and upcoming 
			related works set in the same universe. He was born 1994 in Reno, NV, 
			where he was raised. He prefers writing character-based science fiction 
			stories with a focus on slice-of-life stories. He is a reknowned vegan and 
			coffee adict, cat lover and crazed fan of jumping spiders. In the future, 
			he hopes to be a sponsor for Google and has quite the affinity for their 
			products and services. So, now that the facts have been given, one may find 
			Matthew in the library on a gloomy, cloudy day, snuggling with a cat he 
			smuggled into the library, his hand wrapped around a steaming mug of 
			coffee, the other on his Chromebook typing away or producing artwork.</p>
		<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
		<p>Favorite TV shows include Steven Universe, Doctor Who, and Gravity Falls.</p>
		<p>Favorite music groups include Say Anything, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Marina and 
			the Diamonds.</p>
