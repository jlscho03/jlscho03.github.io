		<h2>An Introduction</h2>
			<p>Eight billion human casualties. The Dex should have won the war, but 
				somehow, humanity prevailed. Only a million people survived, but 
				through the ashes of a broken Earth, the peaceful nation of Apharis 
				arose. A new age for humanity had begun.</p>
			<p>But that was two centuries ago, so unless itâ€™s history class, Vicki, 
				Amanda, and Val have more important things to deal with. The only 
				thing they have in common is their house at the University of Cadfield; 
				Vicki is a quiet loner who cares more about making art than friends, 
				and Amanda is a stuck-up ice queen. But the only thing that matters 
				more to Val than her history degree is making new friends. Sure, her 
				roommates came from different backgrounds and would have never hung 
				out in high school, but college is a new era for them. How hard could 
				it be to put the past to bed?</p>
			<p>In their struggle to get along, they stumble onto something greater 
				than their own problems. These college girls hold the key to Apharis' 
				secrets. They hold the truth behind the Dex and their war on humanity. 
				Everything could change.</p>
