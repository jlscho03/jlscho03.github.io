			<h3><a href="book-1.html">Book One: The Demonics</a></h3>
			<p>Major Langdon Hughes, leader of the Hunters Division, attempts to find a 
				way to kill demonics, but no weapon, no technique, has proven 
				successful.</p>
			<p>Time is ticking down, and the Chapters in Chicago and New York are ready 
				to make an offensive attack on the Fulsera, witches and wizards that 
				caused the destruction of the world. They call out for a Merge of cities 
				under one banner, one goal.</p>
			<p>Hughes isn't ready to abandon his job yet and makes one last effort, 
				putting everything on the line. All for one last chance...</p>

		<a href="book-2.html"><img src="images/badge-2.png" alt="Captain's Badge" width="111" height="111"></a>
			<p>Captain Milton Aleksandrs of the Hunters Division deals with the confusing 
				aftermath of the lockdown at the Jefferson Chapter, and the Merge is 
				finally accepted, prompting several Hunters to journey to Chicago.</p>
			<p>Unexpected alliances are formed, prophecies are revealed, and 
				connections are discovered when it comes to demonics.</p>

		<h3><a href="book-3.html">Book Three: The Immortals</a></h3>
		<a href="book-3.html"><img src="images/badge-3.png" alt="Major's Badge" width="111" height="111"></a>
			<p>Demonics have returned and plague the world once again with their 
				presence, now fully imitating the human appearance. Fear grips not only 
				Nulsera, but Fulsera and Immortals as well.</p>
			<p>No one is free, no one can run, and no one can hide.</p>
			<p>It's a waiting game for all, and not everyone will survive, for the 
				Judge has seen all, and she has awakened.</p>
