		<h2>What's Next after the Hunters Division?</h2>
			<p>While this story has been written, the author still has several story 
				ideas set in th same universe. There are roughly 35 story ideas, of 
				which 30 take place in the same universe. These include stories 
				ranging from prequels, the Fulseran perspective, and expanded stories 
				for side characters or side events mentioned in the first series.</p> 
			<p>However, due to the nature of Book Three's extensive editing, a break 
				is going to be taken from <i>The Hunter's Division</i> upon it's completion to 
				work on a shorter work set in a new universe.</p>
			<p><ins>Idagio</ins> is the first story in <i>The Crystal Song</i> series 
			following 11-year-old Noa Hempworth in a classic fantasy world aimed for a 
			potential middle-grade audience. Work on the novelette's first draft will begin early January 
			of 2016 with a goal completion date of late April of 2016.</p>
		<h3>Idagio</h3>
			<p><b>Disclaimer: Plot and tone subject to change during the course of actually 
				writing the novellette.</b></p>
			<p>11-year-old Noa Hempworth lives on the outskirts of the Empire's lands with her adoptive 
				parents. When a wolf emerges from the woods nearby, she quickly befriends it, 
				but in doing so, she finds herself being isolated at school, her friends 
				abandoning her. The wolf, Idagio, proves to be a 
				good friend for Noa, always being there during the arguments her parents have. 
				But when the Empire starts tracking students for potential military potential, 
				Idagio also proves to be a loyal guardian. But can the wolf-dog Idagio match 
				an Empire official's wolf-dog, Thatch?</p>
